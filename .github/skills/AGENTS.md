# Agent Skills Catalog

Authoritative list of skills for agent loading. Each entry points to a `SKILL.md` with activation
criteria and instructions.

For a human-readable overview, see [README.md](README.md).

## Skills

This repository does not currently have any agent skills configured. Skills can be added as needed
following the structure described in [README.md](README.md).

## Usage

- Load skills from this catalog when the agent needs specialized guidance.
- Follow the instructions in each `SKILL.md`; do not duplicate content here.
- Keep this table in sync when adding or removing skills.
